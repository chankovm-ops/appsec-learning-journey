# Daily Progress Log

## Day 1: [29.11.2025]
**Focus:** Anatomy of a Request/Response
**Resources:** MDN Web Docs & MonsterLessons Academy
**Learnings:**
* **Method:** I saw a `GET` request. This asks the server for data.
* **Status Code:** The server returned `200`, which means "OK".
* **Headers:** I noticed the `User-Agent` header, which tells the server I am using [Your Browser Name].
* **Insight:** I realized that "Cookies" are just lines of text sent in the Header. If I can change this text in Burp Suite later, I might be able to trick the server.

## Day 2: [Date]
**Focus:** Setting up Burp Suite
**Resource:** InsiderPhD Video
**Learnings:**
* Configured FoxyProxy to route traffic to 127.0.0.1:8080.
* Successfully intercepted my first request.
* Explored the "Repeater" tab—it's like a manual API testing tool on steroids.
