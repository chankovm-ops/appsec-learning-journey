# My Journey from QA to Application Security

## 🎯 Goal
To pivot from a Senior Manual QA Engineer (10 YOE) to an Application Security Engineer within 6 months.

## 📚 Strategy
I am leveraging my background in Quality Assurance—specifically my understanding of business logic and edge cases—to master Application Security. My focus is on:
* **Web Application Penetration Testing** (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
* **Network Fundamentals** (HTTP/S, TCP/IP)
* **Secure Coding Practices** (OWASP Top 10)
* **Scripting** (Python for automation)

## 🛠️ Tools
* **Proxy:** Burp Suite Community
* **Labs:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy
* **OS:** Windows / Kali Linux
